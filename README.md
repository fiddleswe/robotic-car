<h1 align="center">Robotic Car Program</h1>
C++ language code for the robotic car as part of my self-directed project for senior project. This is the demo code to testing on my robotic vehicle.

### What is Robotic Vehicle?
Robotic vehicle or Dynamic Robot for Lifting by Remote-Control is part of my technology senior project, the project purpose is to research about robot car to extend it abilities or features and utilise it in day-to-day, the vehicle has built-in feature for lifting any objects that has size of 20 millimeters maximum.  

### Tech Stacks
For this robotic project, I utilise C++ language to program the controller and signal of the robotic car so that it can be remote-control as well as for the feautures to lifting the objects which is also programmed in C++ language. For Integrated development environment (IDE), I programming C++ in Arudino IDE and using Arduino UNO R4 Wifi.
